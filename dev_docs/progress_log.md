- Read the V8 / New V1 integrated design document.
- Reintroduced `dev_docs/` for the new V8 development line.
- Imported the design snapshot as `dev_docs/v8_v1_design.md`.
- Created the phase plan and Phase 1 walking-skeleton tracker.
- Implemented the Phase 1 independent package skeleton.
- Added `tools/pcode_slicegraph_v8_phase1.py`.
- Verified DFB001 and DFB002 across six architecture/platform sample roots.
- Started Phase 2 call boundary skeleton.
- Added CALLSITE, CALL_PRE_* candidates, and safe-lazy CALL_POST_REG candidates.
- Confirmed Phase 2 smoke keeps DFB001/DFB002 at PASS 12.

## Current Focus

Phase 2: Convention-free Call Boundary Skeleton.

Next engineering step:

```text
Introduce CALLSITE / CALL_PRE_* / CALL_POST_* synthetic storage without stale
post-call dependencies.
```
