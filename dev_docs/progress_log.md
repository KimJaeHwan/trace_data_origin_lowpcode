# V8 / New V1 Progress Log

This log records implementation progress by phase. Detailed task checklists live
in the phase-specific files.

## 2026-06-20

- Read the V8 / New V1 integrated design document.
- Reintroduced `dev_docs/` for the new V8 development line.
- Imported the design snapshot as `dev_docs/v8_v1_design.md`.
- Created the phase plan and Phase 1 walking-skeleton tracker.
- Implemented the Phase 1 independent package skeleton.
- Added `tools/pcode_slicegraph_v8_phase1.py`.
- Verified DFB001 and DFB002 across six architecture/platform sample roots.
- Started Phase 2 call boundary skeleton.
- Added CALLSITE, CALL_PRE_* candidates, and safe-lazy CALL_POST_REG candidates.
- Confirmed Phase 2 smoke keeps DFB001/DFB002 at PASS 12.
- Implemented Phase 3 minimal branch PHI merge and control edges.
- Verified DFB010 and DFB014 with separated data/control sources.

## Current Focus

Phase 4: Memory + Architecture Expansion.

Next engineering step:

```text
Lift stack/global/heap storage toward the MemoryObject model while preserving
the current DFB001/002/010/014 regression gates.
```
